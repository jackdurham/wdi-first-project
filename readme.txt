## Challenges Faced
One of the biggest problems I had while creating my project was creating the game logic for the two items of the ball and hoop to register a collision, which was the main point of the game. I eventually saught out help from one of the teachers who guided me in the right direction on where to go which is when i created the function `checkCollison `
