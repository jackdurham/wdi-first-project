## Challenges Faced
One of the biggest problems I had while creating my project was creating the game logic for the two items of the ball and hoop to register a collision, which was the main point of the game. I eventually sought out help from one of the teachers who guided me in the right direction on where to go which is when i created the function `checkCollison `.

## whats next
Now i've finished my project i'd like to work on making it responsive so it will work on mobile and tablets. I got very close during project time to making it work but the background image for my body wasn't working no matter what I tried. So its something i'd like to fix in my own time.
